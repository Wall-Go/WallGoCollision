# Uses scikit-build-core and its conan plugin scikit-build-core-conan to invoke install dependencies with Conan, then invoke CMake normally.
# Makes the Collision module installable with pip:
# pip install . [-v]
# The -v is necessary to see what is going on under the hood (Conan, CMake messages).
# Note that build artifacts will go wherever pip decides to put them .
