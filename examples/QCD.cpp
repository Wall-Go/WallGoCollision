	/* Specify symbolic variables that are present in matrix elements, and their initial values.
	This typically includes at least coupling constants of the theory, but often also masses of fields that appear in internal propagators.
	Depending on your model setup, the propagator masses may or may not match with "particle" masses used elsewhere in WallGo.
	
	In this example the symbols needed by matrix elements are:
		gs -- QCD coupling
		mq2 -- Mass-square of a fermion propagator (thermal part only, so no distinction between quark types)
		mg2 -- Mass-square of a gluon propagator.

	Thermal masses depend on the QCD coupling, however the model definition always needs a numerical value for each symbol.
	This adds some complexity to the model setup, and therefore we do the symbol definitions in stages: 
		1) Define independent couplings
		2) Define helper functions for computing thermal masses from the couplings
		3) Define the mass symbols using initial values computed from the helpers.

	For purposes of this example this approach is overly explicit because the mass expressions are very simple.
	However the helper functions are needed later when defining particle content anyway (assuming non-ultrarelativistic particles), see below.
