/**** Comment about particle masses. Masses in the integrals appear in two places: 
 *  1) Inside dispersion relations, E^2 = p^2 + m^2
 *  2) Inside propagators in the matrix elements
 * Handling of these two kinds of masses is different in the code and usually also in physical applications:
 * 
 * For 1) we use mass-squares defined by ParticleSpecies and get them through our stored CollisionElements.
 * Hence the kinematic factors need to be computed separately for each CollisionElement.
 * For ultrarelativistic (UR) particles this mass is 0.
 * 
 * For 2) we treat these masses similarly to any other parameter in matrix elements, ie. they are variables contained in MatrixElement objects.
 * Note that in leading-log approximation the common approach is to only use thermal masses in propagators. This is NOT built in to our
 * integration logic in any way, but can be achieved by passing the wanted (symbol, value) pair to matrix elements.  
*/

/**** Ultrarelativistic approximations. We separate CollisionElement objects to ultrarelativistic (UR) and non-UR elements.
 * A CollisionElement is UR if all its external particles have the UR flag enabled. For particles, the UR flag means that the
 * their mass is neglected in dispersion relations, ie. E(p) = |p| always. For UR CollisionElements, the kinematic factors
 * can be calculated in a more optimized way. Whether this optimization is used or not is controlled by our bOptimizeUltrarelativistic flag,
 * which can be changed by passing a IntegrationOptions struct to CollisionIntegral4::integrate(). 
 * NOTE: If a particle is UR, its mass is ALWAYS neglected in energy expressions,
 * irrespectively of whether bOptimizeUltrarelativistic is enabled or not. As described above, masses in propagators are treated differently.

/* Kinematics struct - holds data for computing the "kinematic" factor in a collision integral. The kinematic factor is:

/*
Describes a Boltzmann collision integral for 2 -> 2 scattering process. This is always defined per-particle pair,
so that only processes relevant for Boltzmann mixing of those particles are included in a given CollisionIntegral4 object.
"Particle1" refers to the "incoming" particle whose momentum is NOT integrated over; this has 3-momentum p1 and index 'a'.
This is always assumed to be the first particle in each stored CollisionElement.
"Particle2" refers to the other particle to mix with, that is kept fixed but has its momentum integrated over.

Our collision integrals are:
    C_a[\delta f] = 1/4 \sum{bcd} \int d^3p_2 d^3p_3 d^3p_4 / ((2pi)^5 (2E_2 2E_3 2E_4)) * \delta^4(P1 + P2 - P3 - P4) * |M_{ab->cd}|^2 P_{ab->cd}[\delta f]
where we only include processes that include \delta f of "Particle2". In practice the logic for choosing the right processes is handled by the PhysicsModel
at CollisionIntegral4 creation time.

The actual integration is done by analytically reducing the 9D integral to a 5D integral of form:
    1/4 \sum_{bcd} int_{0}^{infty} (dp2 p2^2/E2) (dp3 p3^2/E3) int_{0}^{2pi} dphi2 dphi3 int_{-1}^{1} dcosTheta2 dcosTheta3 Theta(E4) delta(P4^2 - m4^2) |M|^2 P[ij -> mn]
which we then integrate with importance-sampled Monte Carlo.

Notable conventions:
1) Commonly a combinatorical factor 1/N_a (degrees of freedom of 'a' particle) is included in front of the collision integral.
Here we assume it to be contained in the matrix element |M|^2.
2) Similarly, our collision operator comes with factor 1/4 in front to avoid overcounting of some ab->cd processes in the sum over external particles.
The other common convention is 1/2. This difference must also be taken into account if using matrix elements not obtained from the WallGoMatrix companion package.
